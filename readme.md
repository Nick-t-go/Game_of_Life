# To do
- Redo Tests
- Fix placement of slider that allows the user to time-travel and scrub through any
  historical of generations that the model went through
- Add an option for
  [wrap-around](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#/media/File:%D0%98%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0_%22%D0%96%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8C%22.gif)
- Add a preset selector that allows the user to initialize the board to
  [certain cool configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns)
